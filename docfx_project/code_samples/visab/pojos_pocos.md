# Creating POCOs and POJOs

All information sent from games to VISAB is using JSON as its data format.<br>
To enable the respective game to have automated serialization from C# into JSON,<br>
we need POCOS that represent the information to be sent to VISAB.

To correctly deserialize this information, VISAB needs **equivalent** POJOS within its own code.<br>
By **equivalent** it is meant, that these classes need to resemble the exact same attributes and names for them.<br>
Otherwise deserialization on the VISAB file will fail because of unknown attributes.

It is also possible to nest further classes in the POCOS / POJOS, they only need their respective implementation.

##### TetrisMetaInformation POCO
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace VISABConnector.Example.Tetris
{
    public class TetrisMetaInformation : IMetaInformation
    {
        public string Game => "Tetris";

        public IList<string> PlayerNames { get; set; }

        public int PlayerCount => PlayerNames.Count;
    }
}
```

##### TetrisStatistics POCO
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace VISABConnector.Example.Tetris
{
    public class TetrisStatistics : IStatistics
    {
        public int Turn { get; set; }

        public IDictionary<string, int> PlayerPoints { get; set; }
    }
}
```
##### Player POCO
```csharp
namespace VISABConnector.Example.Tetris
{
    public class Player
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public int Score { get; set; }

        public TetrisBoard Board { get; set; }
    }
}
```
##### TetrisBoard POCO
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

namespace VISABConnector.Example.Tetris
{
    public class TetrisBoard
    {
        public Color[,] Board { get; } = new Color[20, 10];
    }
}
```
