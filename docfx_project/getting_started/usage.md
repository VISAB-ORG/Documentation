The HomeView has a navigation bar with  buttons to open the [API-Dashboard](#API-Dashboard) **(1)**, the Settings **(2)** with an <br>
included option to switch between light and dark mode **(11)**, the About **(3)** and the Help **(4)** window. It also shows a view <br>
of the file-system of the  local VISAB database. There are all files with filename, creation date and <br>
size displayed, that belong to the VISAB supported games. The refresh button **(5)** can be used to reload the <br>
database. With the "Show in explorer" button **(6)** the file system will be opened where the selected file or <br>
folder is stored on the system. With the "Rename" button **(7)** a file or folder can be renamed. The "Upload" button **(8)**<br>
opens the systems file explorer, where the user can upload an existing VISAB file to the workspace. <br>
This is also possible via drag and drop into the HomeView. With the "Delete" button **(9)** the selected file or <br>
folder can be deleted. The "VISUALIZE" button **(10)** will open the VisualizerView if a VISAB file is selected.
