# Lets make Tetris fun
Imagine that we have a multiplayer Tetris game, in which two players compete for achieving the highest scores.\
The game is turn-based, where each player has one turn at a time at which to set a stone.\
Additionally to the regular Tetris ruleset, players also have a time limit for their turn which, when exceeded, stops them from getting more points.\
Just for the sake of it, lets say that if a player needs less time than given for his turn, their opponent will get less time for theirs.\
And Boom, there we have it. Quite the interesting Tetris game if you ask me :D

Lets say we have developed such game using Unity3D.
Since we are an avid artificial intelligence and especially case-based-reasoning enjoyer, we have also developed a CBR-based system for controlling players in our game.

Eventhought our system works well when a small amount of Tetris blocks is placed, it seems to struggle once the screen fills up.\
To figure out what could possibily be missing in our CBR-system implementation, we decide that we want to visualize the data using VISAB.
